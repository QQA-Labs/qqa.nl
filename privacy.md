# Privacy Policy (QQA Labs)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-22

QQA Labs (“we”) builds apps with a **privacy-first** approach. We collect as little data as possible and only use it to provide functionality and improve reliability.

## What we collect

Depending on the app, we may process the following:

### 1) Data stored on your device
- game/app progress (e.g., puzzles), settings, and statistics  
This data is stored locally on your device.

### 2) Diagnostics / crash data (optional)
If enabled, we may use crash/diagnostics tools to improve stability.  
We do not intentionally collect the content of your notes or puzzles unless explicitly stated.

### 3) Support email
If you email us, we receive your email address and whatever information you choose to share.

## What we do not do
- We do not sell personal data
- We do not use data brokers
- We do not run ad-network tracking unless an app is explicitly ad-supported (and clearly labeled)

## Sharing with third parties
We may share limited data only when necessary for:
- app store payments (Apple/Google) for purchases
- crash/diagnostics providers (if enabled)

## Data retention
- Local app data: kept as long as you keep the app installed
- Support emails: kept as long as needed to resolve your request

## Your choices
- You can delete local app data by uninstalling the app.
- You can request deletion of support emails by contacting us.
